## Purpose

    To visualize the properties of linear transformations on matrices. This is
    done through a plane (point) traveling through space. The plane's Roll,
    Pitch, and Yaw can be adjusted through the command line prompt. The program
    will output an accurate rotation matrix, matrix-vector equation, and new
    position in R^3.
